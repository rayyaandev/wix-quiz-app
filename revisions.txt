Change first line to: This isn't your average travel questionnaire. - 
In line 1 there is a word mistake. should be " carefully designed sections" please refer to question list.

- Missing page: Your profile is here" page is missing. Should be after email and before final results page

Results Page - Why is the header image blurry. Please make this clear and adjust text box spacing slightly. - Scoring incorrect. May be due to the missing questions but once you have updated those, please double check the scoring to ensure it matches and the correct results are generated for both the main archetype and the 2 closest archetype matches as these are also incorrect. - Closest matches are incorrect. Please adjust and make sure the percentage are accurate. - Learn about me buttons should link to a page. Please can you advise me on how we can do this. I can send you each page to be linked if needed for all buttons - Community addition was a great idea! Thank you - Lease some more padding/spacing at the sides of all the text boxes eg.: About your archetype & How you're seen. Please refer to the reference images previously sent. - Please enlarge the headers and ensure all are in the correct color. Please refer to the reference images previously sent. - About your archetype should have a white box around it or alternatively you can just make the text boxes a brighter border or fill color to stand out and break the solid color. - Enlarge the Plane "recommended destinations icon) slightly - About your archetype section headers should be higher up with more spacing away from the other text. Please refer to the reference images previously sent. - White box for " how to travel better" section should be smaller. More of the photo needs to show and the text is too close to the edge of the box. You have also repeated the question twice here. Please only put the first part in bold. Again refer to the reference images previously sent. - Some of the recommendations are mission on the results pages. Please update this to reflect all. Please refer to the reference images previously sent. - Please check all padding/spacing is accurate. i don't want to text too near the sides. - Do you need the social media links? please can you change the button from social cards to the icons as they should be able to only select to share on the social media platforms we are on. - Again, please check all buttons for the correct text. The recommendation buttons are incorrect.
Hi, please can you review and make the changes as soon as possible as this is already very behind and was due for release today. Thank you
