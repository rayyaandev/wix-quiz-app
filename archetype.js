    overview:
      "You’re not your average traveler. You’re a cultural explorer, piecing together the puzzle of a place through its people, food, art, and language. When you step off the plane, you’re not reaching for the nearest luxury shuttle; you’re scanning the streets, listening to local conversations, and hoping that first segment of your trip will reveal a story. Your curiosity doesn’t stop at museums or landmarks, it’s fueled by conversations in local cafés, deep dives into family’s cooking traditions, and uncharted side-streets with centuries-old architecture. You crave depth over breadth, peeling back the various layers of a destination. You’re the one who lingers at a craftsman’s stall, asking the maker about his technique, or conversing with a street artist about his mural. Every destination becomes an ally in your own expanding worldview. You consistently choose immersion over isolation, curiosity over convenience, and authenticity over aesthetics. You’re energized by experiences that feel real: like sharing a supper with a local family, learning a regional dialect, and local-hosted walking tours through new neighborhoods.",
    howYoureSeen:
      " With you on the trip, friends and fellow travelers immediately sense the richness you bring. You're the storyteller, the person who reconnects everyone with why they came and sometimes, why they’ll return. You’re both approachable and quietly authoritative on navigating local culture and etiquette. Strangers turn into chess partners at alleyway cafés, hosts become friends, and every shared meal hums with meaning. You flourish alongside fellow Cultural Connoisseurs and Creative Mavericks those who savor slow street walks, independent language learning, and daylong curiosity. You'll also connect beautifully with Academic Adventurers who love context. However, you might feel impatient with Comfort travelers and Family Connectors who are satisfied with guidebook highlights and tourist staples and you’ll probably clash with Hedonists, whose definition of travel tangles more with nightlife than nuance.",

    overview:
      "You’re not just going somewhere, you’re searching for something. That “something” might be healing, purpose, clarity, or peace. You feel the world deeply, and travel, for you, is a form of personal transformation. Whether it’s journaling under a banyan tree or reflecting during a sunrise meditation, you use each journey to check in with yourself.<br><br>You're drawn to places with a certain energy - ancient temples, forest paths, oceans that seem to whisper answers. You move intuitively with intentional softness and grace. You’re drawn more to sound baths than large parties. Your trips don’t have to be perfect. They just need to feel meaningful. In your suitcase: herbal teas, a good pen, and a few books that have changed your life. In your mind: open space, quiet curiosity, and the desire to come home lighter than you left.",
    howYoureSeen:
      "Traveling with you is like hitting pause on the noise. You remind others to slow down, take a breath, and check in with their inner world. You’re grounding to be around.

    overview:
      "It’s not just about the adrenaline. It’s about remembering what it means to be fully awake, toes in the soil, breath racing with the wind. You chase altitudes, extremes, and wild terrain. For you, travel is the ultimate way to feel alive. The view from the top of a volcano, the air before a storm, the stillness just after a leap. Those are the moments that make it all worth it. Comfort isn’t your priority, experience is. Hotels are fine, but if there’s an option to sleep in a hammock under the stars or wake up early for a wave, you’re in. Whether it’s surfing before breakfast, ziplining through jungle canopies, or hiking into volcanic craters, you come alive in moments of movement. You see travel as a way to test your edges and reconnect with your rawest instincts. <br><br>You’re naturally curious, often choosing remote or rugged destinations that let you challenge yourself physically and mentally. Your energy is infectious. You’re often the one pulling others into spontaneous adventures or cheering them on as they try something new. You don’t shy away from the elements, you lean into them, welcoming mud, sweat, and open skies. To you, a trip is only successful if you’ve felt the wind in your face, your heart pounding, and the thrill of trying something you didn’t know you could do.",
    howYoureSeen:
      "You’re the one people call when they need courage. Your friends admire your fearless spirit, even if they sometimes struggle to keep up. You turn strangers into teammates on treks and bring a powerful sense of momentum to any group. People trust you to find the hidden path, the coolest water sport, or the boldest local dish. You pair really well with Hedonists, who enjoy the ride, but also with Hybrid Nomads, who appreciate challenge and freedom in equal measure. Less so with Luxe Seekers or Comfort Travelers, who may not share your idea of a “fun” day (or night) out in the wild.",

You believe travel should feel exceptional, and you're unapologetic about prioritizing pleasure. Whether it’s a room with panoramic views, an after-hours shopping session or a last-minute table at a Michelin-starred spot, you move through the world with quiet assurance, knowing that thoughtful details are what elevate a journey from good to unforgettable.<br><br>You don’t just want luxury for show, you want travel to feel composed, considered, and yours alone. It’s about intention. You know the worth of your time, so your itinerary reflects quality over chaos. You might spend your day with a private guide through a new gallery, and you’re evening on a yacht with champagne in hand, not to impress anyone, but because it’s your idea of a well-lived life. You’ve worked hard for this, and your travel style reflects that same level of care.",
    howYoureSeen:
      "You’re the one who sets the tone for a trip. Friends know you’ll find the perfect restaurant, the most serene spa, or the most exclusive experience without breaking a sweat. Your confidence and refined taste make you a natural leader in travel groups, someone who others rely on to make moments feel special.

You're not just here to see a place; you're here to feel it, soak it in, and maybe even get a little lost in it. Whether it's a city, a stranger, or a version of yourself you've never met before, every trip holds the possibility of transformation. To you, destinations are characters. A city can flirt with you, a coastline can hold you, and a night sky can make you feel understood. You don't always plan with logic, you follow a feeling. A hunch. A curiosity. That's how you end up walking into a tucked-away perfumery in Marrakech, or dancing barefoot at midnight in someone's garden in Lisbon.<br><br>You might be at a turning point in your life or just craving a space to feel things more deeply. Either way, your version of travel is a soft reset. You want your senses reawakened, sun-warmed skin, handwritten menus, the scent of fresh flowers at dusk. Even if you're solo, you're never really alone. The world feels like it's in conversation with you. And if romance finds you? Even better. But really, you're here to fall deeper in love with life.

      "Travel doesn't have to mean shaking up your whole world. You don't need constant novelty to feel fulfilled. In fact, the best kind of travel for you is the kind that feels like a cozy blanket — familiar, low-stress, and easy to navigate. Maybe you're easing into international travel, had high-pressure trips in the past, or maybe you just know what you like. Either way, you'd rather return to a destination you trust than gamble on somewhere that disrupts your flow. You love knowing what to expect, warm weather, friendly service, and food that doesn't need explaining. That's not boring to you. It's relaxing.<br><br>Your preferences lean toward well-organized day tours, familiar foods, and destinations where you won't need to decipher every sign or menu. All-inclusives, cruises, and beachside resorts are more your rhythm than rugged exploration. You're not here to reinvent yourself, you're here to rest, unwind, and feel good.
